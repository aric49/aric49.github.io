I am a Husband, IT Engineer, Geek, and armchair Christian theologian who lives in the Charlotte, NC area.  I am passionate about open source technology, programming, infrastructure-as-code, cloud, and containerization technologies. I have also written two books, "Containerization with Ansible 2" and "The Docker Workshop", both published by Pact Publishing. The purpose behind this blog is to provide a platform with which I can publish information about technology including re-usable code snippets, guides, and tips that I have learned a long the way. I am active on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Matrix.org
